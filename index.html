            Hello, and Welcome to my Page!  My name is Erin Beatty and I am currently the Director of IT and Marketing for Gas Express LLC.  We are the Largest Circle K Franchise group in the nation.  We currently operate 106 stores in 5 states, and expect to be 200 Stores by the end of 2022.  I have been working in the IT field for 10 years, mostly focused in the Convenience and Fueling sector.  Before I branched into IT, I was a Graphic Production Artist.   I mostly focused on Trade Show Graphics, Large Format Digital Imaging, Vehicle/Building Wraps, and Mixed Media.  When I'm not working (which isnt often), I like to travel.  Escpecially when the destination is a beach.  If I had a Hobby, it would be playing Texas Hold'em Poker.  I hope you like what you see!
